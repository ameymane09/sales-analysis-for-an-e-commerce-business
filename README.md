Case study on sales data for an e-commerce business that needed a marketing strategy for next year. Full analysis and the conclusions drawn are in the Jupyter Notebook itself.

Please Note: Github does not allow interactive charts and hence, you won't be able to see any visualisations (using Plotly) that I've made. I recommend you to open the notebook in Kaggle for a better viewing experience. To do so, press the `Open in Kaggle` button located at the top of the notebook or the link below:
